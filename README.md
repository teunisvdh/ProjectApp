## Problem Statement 
Everyday millions of people travel by train to go to work or school. 
For a traveler this trip can be very boring. 
The period of time spent in the train usually is too short for doing a lot of work, but too much for doing nothing. 
Most people reach out to their phones, but even then don't know what to do exactly: watching a part of a Netflix series or browsing through Facebook until reaching the destination?
