# REPORT

## Summary 
Everyday people have some time left between activities. However, watching a movie most of the times takes too long to pass the time, but the time is too long to keep staring out of the window. A tool that creates entertainment for just exactly the time you have to pass is needed.

VideoBreak will assure that you can watch a personalised YouTube playlist while traveling, waiting for someone, lunch and many more activities. THe dureation won't exceed the time you have.
